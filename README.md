Echode [![Build Status](http://marksomns.playat.ch:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=echode)](http://marksomns.playat.ch:8080/job/echode/)
====
Echode is a programming language, designed to be simple.

It is still in development, there isn't any download yet. But if you feel adventurous, nab the latest build at jenkins.
Remember, however, that jenkins builds are automated and very much unfinished. Proceed at your own risk. :shipit:


Echode itself is made in Java. (Don't worry if you don't know what that is)
